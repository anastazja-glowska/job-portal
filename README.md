✅ Why I Built This
As an aspiring Junior Java Developer, I wanted to create something practical and real-world. JobPortal is my personal project where I explored:

Real authentication/authorization flows

Entity relationships with JPA

Handling file uploads and downloads (CVs)

Building a user-friendly and functional UI with Thymeleaf

Writing robust tests using modern testing tools

This project taught me how to think like a developer — from architecture to debugging to polish and usability.
